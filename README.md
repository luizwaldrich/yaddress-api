# YAddress REST API
Automated REST API tests with YAddress API.

## About
YAddress is an API for postal address correction, validation, standardization and geocoding.

You can learn more about them in their [documentation](https://www.yaddress.net/Home/WebApi).

## How to run
I decided to use two different tools to test the same thing.

### Postman with Data-Driven
To run Postman solution, please, view the [README.md](postman/README.md) file in [postman folder](postman).

### Java Rest Assured
To run the Rest Assured solution, please, view the  [README.md](rest-assured/README.md) file in [rest-assured folder](rest-assured).
